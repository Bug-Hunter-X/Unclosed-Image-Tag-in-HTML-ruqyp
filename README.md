This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML: an unclosed image tag. The bug.html file contains an image tag that's missing the closing tag. This can lead to unexpected layout issues in some browsers and may cause issues when parsing the HTML.

The solution is to ensure that all HTML tags are properly closed. The bugSolution.html file provides a corrected version of the code.
